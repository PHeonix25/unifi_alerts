## 🟡 High-value improvements

### Verify update-in-place works without HA reboot
**Problem:** Unknown whether updating the integration (e.g. via HACS or copying files) requires a full Home Assistant restart, or whether reloading the config entry is sufficient. A reboot requirement would be a significant friction point for self-hosted users pushing frequent updates.
**Fix:** Test the update-in-place flow manually:
1. Install the integration and confirm it is working.
2. Update the integration files (e.g. simulate a HACS update by copying a newer version).
3. Reload the config entry via **Settings → Integrations → UniFi Alerts → ⋮ → Reload**.
4. Confirm all entities recover and no HA restart is required.
If a restart is required, investigate why (e.g. Python module caching, import-time side effects, platform registration) and fix so a config entry reload is sufficient. Document the expected update flow in `README.md`.

## 🟢 Nice-to-have

### Config entry repair flow
If authentication fails after setup (e.g. password changed), HA should surface a repair notification prompting the user to re-enter credentials rather than just showing the entry as unavailable.
**Reference:** `homeassistant.helpers.issue_registry` and `async_create_issue`.

### Replace placeholder `brand/icon.png` with a real 256×256 icon
The current brand asset is a minimal placeholder PNG. Replace with a proper UniFi-themed icon before submitting to the HACS default catalogue.

### HACS default repository submission
After the integration is stable and passes `hassfest`, submit a PR to https://github.com/hacs/default to be listed in the default HACS catalogue. Requirements: 2+ releases, passing CI, `hacs.json`, `info.md`, HA brand icon.
- `info.md` is now present (added session 11).
- Remaining: 2+ tagged releases, real brand icon (replace placeholder), PR submission to hacs/default.

## 🐛 Known issues / technical debt

### `_device_info` duplication
The `_device_info()` helper function is duplicated identically across `binary_sensor.py`, `sensor.py`, `event.py`, and `button.py`. Intentional for platform isolation but could be extracted to a shared `entity_base.py` mixin if it becomes a maintenance burden.
