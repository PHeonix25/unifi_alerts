"""Severity normalization and minimum-severity gating for the integration.

Maps the raw, ingestion-path-specific severity string (webhook payload, legacy
`/list/alarm` record, or v2 `system-log` event) onto one of exactly four
ordered Severity_Level values, and provides the comparison/lookup helpers used
by the per-category Minimum_Severity_Setting gate on both the webhook push
path and the polling path. See docs/UNIFI.md for the documented severity
ordering and synonym table.
